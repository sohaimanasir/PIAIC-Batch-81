# SkillCreator for Portfolio Project

## Purpose

This helps create skill files for my portfolio website in markdown format. Each skill file should be clear, structured, and ready to use.

## How it works

1. Ask for the **Skill Name**
2. Ask for a **Short Description** of the skill (1–2 sentences)
3. Ask for **Key Points or Details** in bullet points
4. Generate the **complete SKILL.md** file in markdown format

## Output

- Use headings and bullet points
- Make it clear and easy for Claude/Qwen to read
- Ready to save in `.claude/skills/`
