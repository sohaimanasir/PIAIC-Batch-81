# Portfolio Website Project

## Purpose

Build a personal portfolio website to showcase my web development projects, skills, and experience. The website should be modern, minimal, professional, and user-friendly.

## Technology Stack

- HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only (no frameworks)
- Responsive and mobile-first design
- Dark mode support
- Clean, maintainable, and well-commented code

## Structure / Sections

1. **Home:** Introduction with name, role, and a short tagline.
2. **About:** Brief bio or description of experience.
3. **Skills:** Include all skills described in the `.claude/skills/` markdown files, highlighting UI/UX design and other technical skills.
4. **Projects:** Display web development projects with:
   - Project name
   - Short description
   - Link to live demo or repository
5. **Contact:** Simple contact form or email link.

## Style & UX

- Modern, minimalistic, and professional design
- Dark mode support
- Apply UI/UX best practices (good layout, readable typography, clear navigation)
- Smooth transitions/animations using CSS or JS where appropriate
- Accessible design (good contrast, semantic HTML)

## Output Requirements

- Provide complete HTML, CSS, and JS files
- Include comments explaining the purpose of each section
- Keep file structure simple:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css`
  - `script.js`
  - Reference skills from `.claude/skills/` markdown files to populate the Skills section

## Notes

- Prioritize clarity and readability
- Make the design visually appealing but not overly complex
- Use vanilla JS for interactivity (no libraries or frameworks)
